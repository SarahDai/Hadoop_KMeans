# Hadoop_KMeans

K-Means clustering is a popular algorithm for clustering similar objects into K groups (clusters). 
It starts with an initial seed of K points (randomly chosen) as centers, and then the algorithm iteratively tries to enhance these centers. 
The algorithm terminates either when two consecutive iterations generate the same K centers, i.e., the centers did not change, or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
